 * Manages background audio playback for LiveKit agent sessions
 *
 * This class handles playing ambient sounds and manages audio track publishing.
 * It supports:
 * - Continuous ambient sound playback with looping
 * - Thinking sound playback during agent processing
 * - Multiple simultaneous audio streams via AudioMixer
 * - Volume control and probability-based sound selection
 * - Integration with LiveKit rooms and agent sessions
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const player = new BackgroundAudioPlayer({
 *   ambientSound: { source: BuiltinAudioClip.OFFICE_AMBIENCE, volume: 0.8 },
 *   thinkingSound: { source: BuiltinAudioClip.KEYBOARD_TYPING, volume: 0.6 },
 * });
 *
 * await player.start({ room, agentSession });
 * ```
